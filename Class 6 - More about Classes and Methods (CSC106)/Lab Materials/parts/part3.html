		<p>
			In this final exercise, you will modify an existing Xamarin.Forms application to add three constructors to the <code>BankAccount</code> class. 
            The three different constructors will initialize the data in the class. To complete the exercise, you will perform the following steps:
      </p>


      <ol>
         <li>Add a default <code>BankAccount</code> constructor to initialize the properties to default values.</li>
         <li>Add a second constructor that takes a string parameter to initialize the account name.</li>
         <li>Add a third constructor that takes three parameters to initialize the balance, last deposit date, and account name.</li>
         <li>Chain two of the constructors into the third to share the initialization logic.</li>
       </ol>

      <p>When you are finished, your application will look like:</p>
      <img src="./res/images/completed-lab3.PNG" />

      <h2>Required Assets</h2>
      <p>
          The provided <strong>Resources</strong> folder for this part contains a subfolder named <strong>Start</strong> with a solution
          you will use as starter code. The <strong>Completed</strong> subfolder contains a completed project you can use to check your work.

         Try to use the picture and above steps to complete the lab exercise, referring to the slides if you need any help in creating the bank account application.
         You can also use the following step-by-step instructions to fill in any knowledge gaps.
      </p>

		<h2>Define a constructor to initialize the Bank Account</h2>
		<ol>
         <li>
            Open the <b>Constructors.sln</b> solution from the <b>Resources/Start</b> folder.
         </li>
         
         <li>
            Open the <b>BankAccount.cs</b> file and examine the contents. It has some properties to hold basic account information and a method that returns
             a string representing all the data in the account.
         </li>

         <li>
            Run the app to see the starting output - it should show three lines, with no real data. As with the other labs we've done, the UI code is all
             in the <b>MainPage.cs</b> file. You can open the file to see how the three accounts are created currently. Notice as well, that this is all
             done in the <em>constructor</em> for the <code>MainPage</code>! You've been using constructors already, we just hadn't really examined them yet!
         </li>

         <li>
            Flip back to the <code>BankAccount</code> class. Notice there are no constructors defined for the class. Remember from the lecture that C# will
            automatically create one for you (a default constructor that takes no parameters). This is what is allowing us to create the <code>BankAccount</code>
            in the <b>MainPage.cs</b> file.
         </li>

         <li>
            Add a constructor that takes a <code>string</code> for the account name. Recall that the syntax for a constructor is
            <code>public ClassName ( ... parameters ... )</code>. In the code for the constructor, assign the parameter to the <code>AccountName</code>
             property and initialize the other properties to some values. Here's an example, feel free to set the other properties to different values if you like.
         </li>

<pre class="codeblock prettyprint">
public BankAccount ( string accountName )
{
   AccountName = accountName;
   Balance = 0;
   LastDeposit = DateTime.Now;
   IsActive = true;
}
</pre>

         <li>
            Try to build the application. What happens? It should <em>fail</em> to compile now because you do not have a matching constructor that takes no
             parameters for <code>BankAccount</code>. Since you added a constructor, C# is no longer creating the default constructor for us. Let's fix that.
         </li>

         <li>
            Open the <b>MainPage.cs</b> file and change each of the lines that are creating the <code>BankAccount</code> to pass a string - you can use
             any value you like, for example <code>"College Fund"</code> or <code>"Savings"</code>.
         </li>

         <li>
            Build and run the application - it should succeed this time and show you output with the proper name of the account.
         </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Adding multiple constructors</h2>
      <p>
         Another way you could solve the compile error you got earlier is to add an explicit default constructor to the <code>BankAccount</code>.
      </p>

      <ol>
         <li>
            Open the <b>BankAccount.cs</b> file.
         </li>
         <li>
            Add a second constructor that takes no parameters - remember this is called the <em>default</em> constructor.
             It should also be public and initialize the account with empty values like this:
         </li>

<pre class="codeblock prettyprint">
// Default constructor
public BankAccount ( )
{
   AccountName = "Unknown Account";
   Balance = 0;
   LastDeposit = new DateTime ( );
   IsActive = false;
}
</pre>
         <li>
            Open the <b>MainPage.cs</b> file and change the first <code>BankAccount</code> to use your default constructor - just remove the string you added earlier.
         </li>

         <li>
            Run the app and notice that the first account is now printed differently - with different values.
         </li>

         <li>
            Add a final constructor which takes all three parameters:
            <ul class="indent-none">
               <li><code>double balance</code></li>
               <li><code>DateTime lastDeposit</code></li>
               <li><code>string accountName</code></li>
            </ul>
            Use the passed values to initialize the account properties.
         </li>

<p class="indent-none"><a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this, 'p-constructor'); return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a><div id="p-constructor" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
public BankAccount ( 
   double balance, 
   DateTime lastDeposit, 
   string accountName )
{
   Balance = balance;
   LastDeposit = lastDeposit;
   AccountName = accountName;
   IsActive = true;
}
</pre></div></p>

         <li>
            Open the <b>MainPage.cs</b> file and change the final <code>BankAccount</code> to use your full constructor, passing all three values; the lab exercise uses:
            <ul class="indent-none">
               <li>50000</li>
               <li>new DateTime ( 2014, 7, 10, 15, 0, 0 )</li>
               <li>"Checking"</li>
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li>
            Run the application and see the results, it should look something like:
         </li>
      </ol>
      <img src="./res/images/final-output-lab3.PNG" />

      <h2>Chaining constructors</h2>
      <p>
         What you have currently is perfectly fine; however, you might have noticed we are repeating code in each of the constructors. 
          This is generally considered a bad practice in programming because there is no automatic way to keep the three blocks of code
          synchronized if people start making changes. However, C# has a nifty trick which can help here - you can <em>chain</em> the
          constructors so you pass one constructor onto another. This is particularly valuable when you have a full constructor that
          takes a bunch of parameters and then a few constructors which do not, but perform the same initialization.
      </p>

      <ol>
         <li>
            Open the <b>BankAccount.cs</b> file and use the <code>: this(....)</code> syntax on your default constructor to call to
             the final constructor that takes three parameters. Here's what it looks like in code, notice you can remove
             <em>most of the code</em> that you used earlier? That's because the code in the other constructor will do the initialization
             for you. You still want to set the <code>IsActive</code> property to <code>false</code> however, because the other
             constructor assumes the account is active which you don't want here.
         </li>

<pre class="codeblock prettyprint">
public BankAccount ( )
      : this(0, new DateTime(), "Unknown Account")
{
   IsActive = false;
}
</pre>
         <li>
            Do the same for the constructor that takes an account name.
         </li>

<p class="indent-none"><a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this, 'c-constructor'); return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a><div id="c-constructor" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
public BankAccount ( string accountName )
      : this ( 0, DateTime.Now, accountName )
{
}
</pre></div></p>

         <li>
            If you have time, try using default parameters to initialize the balance so you don't need to pass zero each time. 
             Remember that default parameters need to be at the <em>end</em> of the parameter list so you'll have to reorder
             the parameters (and fix your code in <b>MainPage.cs</b>). The final solution has this code in place if you want to check your work.
         </li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
   		In this lab exercise, you add constructors to pass parameters to BankAccount balance, lastDeposit and AccountName. 
          You also added a default constructor to declare bank activity - great job!
     </p>
