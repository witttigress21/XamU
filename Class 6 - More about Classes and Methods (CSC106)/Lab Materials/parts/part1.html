        <p>
            In this exercise, you will modify a Xamarin.Forms application to display possible computer purchases. The price you show will be determined by
            the parameters passed into a method. If you use the lab instructions, your UI will look something like:
        </p>

        <h2>Required Assets</h2>
        <p>
            The provided <strong>Resources</strong> folder for this part contains a subfolder named <strong>Start</strong> with a solution
            you will use as starter code. The <strong>Completed</strong> subfolder contains a completed project you can use to check your work.
        </p>

        <h1 id="steps">Steps</h1>

        <h2>Use a normal method with parameters</h2>
        <p>
            You are going to start with a pre-built program for purchasing computers. There are three different computer types you can buy, and with each one you can
            choose to get a warranty and/or have the technical team setup the computer for you. Based on the choices you make, a final price is calculated.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Launch Visual Studio and open the <strong>OptionalParameters.sln</strong> file in the
                <strong>Resources/Start</strong> folder.
            </li>
           
            <li>
                Open the <b>MainPage.cs</b> file - this is part of the first project in your solution and is the one in which you will do all your work.
            </li>
            <img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/lab1-step2.png" />
            <li>
                Add some computer choices using the <code>PlaceOrder</code> method. Go ahead and add some variations by changing the computer
                (use the predefined Computer1, Computer2 and Computer3 strings), and the booleans for AppleCare and computer setup and see what
                results display on the screen when you run the application. For example, you could use the code below, or provide your own combinations.
            </li>
            <p>
<pre class="codeblock prettyprint">
void PlaceOrders()
{
   // TODO: add some computer choices using the PlaceOrder method
   PlaceOrder(Computer1, false, false);
   PlaceOrder(Computer2, true, false);
   PlaceOrder(Computer2, false, true);
   PlaceOrder(Computer1, true, true);
}
</pre>
            </p>

            <img src="./res/images/lab1-step3.png" class="indent-none" />
        </ol>
        <h2>Add optional parameters</h2>
        <p>
            Management has decided that they want to really push the support and setup benefit, so every sale should default to having both of those turned on.
            You are going to modify the <code>PlaceOrder</code> method to set those two parameters to <code>true</code> by default.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Change the <code>PlaceOrder</code> method to set the two final parameters to <code>true</code> by default.
                </li>
<pre class="codeblock prettyprint">
void PlaceOrder ( string computer, bool appleCare <span class="highlight">= true</span>, bool setUp <span class="highlight">= true</span>)
</pre>

                <li>
                    Run the program and see how this change affects the existing calls. It should look exactly like it did before since we are explicitly passing all the parameters.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Now, remove the booleans from some of your calls to see the defaults being used - run the application and see how the price is changed.
                    Try different variations - passing <code>false</code> for the first boolean and leaving the second off, leaving both off, supplying both, etc.
                </li>
            </ol>


            <!-- - - - - - - - - Summary - - - - - - - - -->
            </ol>

            <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            In this lab exercise, you added several variations to the <code>PlaceOrder</code> method. You also added default values to two booleans to see how
            those changes would display on the screen.
